# ScrollStage — Native CSS Scroll-Driven Story

A modern long-form page using **CSS Scroll-Driven Animations**:
- Pure CSS `@scroll-timeline`, `view-timeline`, `animation-timeline`
- Parallax-ish layers, clip-reveal, and staged fades with no JS timelines
- Progressive enhancement + reduced-motion support
- Hard-scoped CSS (Elementor/Astra safe)

## Run
Open `index.html` or use VS Code Live Preview.

## Notes
- Where Scroll-Driven Animations aren’t supported, content remains fully readable (no fancy motion).
- Toggle "Reduce motion" in your OS/browser to see the fallback path.
